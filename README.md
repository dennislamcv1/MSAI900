### Applied Learning Project

You will engage in interactive exercises throughout this program that offers opportunities to practice and implement what you are learning. You will use the Microsoft Learn Sandbox and work directly with services and resources on Microsoft Azure Portal. You will explore Microsoft Azure and get hands-on with live Microsoft Azure resources and services. The beauty about this is that you will be working with real technology but in a controlled environment, which allows you to apply what you learn, and at your own pace.

You will need a Microsoft account to sign into the Sandbox and use Azure services. If you don't have one, you can create one for free. The Learn Sandbox allows free, fixed-time access to a cloud subscription with no credit card required. Learners can safely explore, create, and manage resources without the fear of incurring costs or "breaking production".
